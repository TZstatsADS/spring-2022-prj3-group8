## Project 3 
### Weakly supervised learning: label noise and correction


Team members: Sibo Geng, Xiran Lin, Joel Mugyenyi, Rhea Sablani, Jiuru Wang

Summary: In this project, we developed two models, one for training the labels of the images with the given labels, and another for training the labels with semi-supervised learning. With 96% accuracy training under semi-supervised learning and with 86% accuracy trainng under the predicted clean lables.

[Contribution Statement] 

Joel and Rhea

Sibo, Xiran, and Jiuru as a team worked on label cleansing. We discussed and tried several models on **torchssl**, and by comparison, we found **flexmatch** is the best among the models we tried.
