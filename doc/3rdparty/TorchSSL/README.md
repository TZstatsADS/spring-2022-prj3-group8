## News and Updates

*15/02/2021*

- The logs and model weights are shared! We notice that some model weights are missing. We will try to upload the missing model weights in the future.
- The results of BestAcc have been updated! I use single P100 for CIFAR-10 and SVHN, single P40 for STL-10, signle V100-32G for CIFAR-100.

## Introduction

TorchSSL is an all-in-one toolkit based on PyTorch for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Currently, we implmented 9 popular SSL algorithms to enable fair comparison and boost the development of SSL algorithms.

**Supported algorithms:** In addition to fully-supervised (as a baseline), TorchSSL supports the following popular algorithms:

1. PiModel (NeurIPS 2015) [1]
2. MeanTeacher (NeurIPS 2017) [2]
3. PseudoLabel (ICML 2013) [3]
4. VAT (Virtual adversarial training, TPAMI 2018) [4]
5. MixMatch (NeurIPS 2019) [5]
6. UDA (Unsupervised data augmentation, NeurIPS 2020) [6]
7. ReMixMatch (ICLR 2019) [7]
8. FixMatch (NeurIPS 2020) [8]
9. FlexMatch (NeurIPS 2021) [9]

Besides, we implement our Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL) method for Pseudo-Label (Flex-Pseudo-Label) and UDA (Flex-UDA).

**Supported datasets:** TorchSSL currently supports 5 popular datasets in SSL research:

1. CIFAR-10
2. CIFAR-100
3. STL-10
4. SVHN
5. ImageNet

## Main Results

The results are best accuracies with standard errors. In the results, "40", "250", "1000" etc. under the dataset row denote different numbers of labeled samples (e.g., "40" in CIFAR-10 means that there are only 4 labeled samples for each class). We use random seed 0,1,2 for all experiments. All configs are included under the `config/` folder. You can directly cite these results in your own research. 

Note FullySupervised results are from training the model using all training data in the dataset, regardless of the label amount denoted in the table.

## Usage

Before running or modifing the code, you need to:
1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Make sure Anaconda or Miniconda is installed.
3. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` for environment initialization.

### Run the experiments

It is convenient to perform experiment with TorchSSL. For example, if you want to run FlexMatch algorithm:

1. Modify the config file in `config/flexmatch/flexmatch.yaml` as you need
2. Run `python flexmatch.py --c config/flexmatch/flexmatch.yaml`

### Customization

If you want to write your own algorithm, please follow the following steps:

1. Create a directory for your algorithm, e.g., `SSL`, write your own model file `SSl/SSL.py` in it. 
2. Write the training file in `SSL.py`
3. Write the config file in `config/SSL/SSL.yaml`

## Statements

*For ImageNet datasets:* Please download the ImageNet 2014 dataset (unchanged from 2012) from the official site (link: https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/2012-downloads.php)
Extract the train and the val set into *subfolders* (the test set is not used), and put them under `train/` and `val/` respectively. Each subfolder will represent a class.
Note: the offical val set is not zipped into subfolders by classes, you may want to use: https://github.com/jiweibo/ImageNet/blob/master/valprep.sh, which is a nice script for preparing the file structure.
