### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

model_II and model_II_final are created using simple CNNs. advancecnn.h5 and basecnn.h5 are created using more complex CNNS. advancecnn.h5 and basecnn.h5 provide better performance and are thus chosen as the final models for MODEL_I and MODEL_II respectively. model_RESNET is a pretrained model but we deem advancecnn.h5 and basecnn.h5 to have a better performance than it. predicted_clean_label.csv and data_csv.csv are output results from our label cleaning exercises.
