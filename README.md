+ Project summary: In this project, we use *linear regression* as our baseline model. We developed a model, which contains 8 layer, and trained this model with noisy labels. We got approximately 26% accuracy as a result. Then, we use semi-supervised learning on the noisy labels, which yield about 96% accuracy of the labels. We put the *"predicted cleaned labels"* into our model and did the same training, after all we got about 68% accuracy, which is way better than the one with noisy labels.
